# Refactor Code

## Explanation

During the comprehensive review of the `BookingController`, it was identified that a targeted code refactoring effort could significantly enhance the maintainability and readability of the codebase. Specifically, one method within the controller was identified for separation of concerns to improve the overall organization of the code.

In addition to the controller, observations were made regarding recurring patterns in the code. Notably, the repetition of lines of code, such as the `getTranslatorType($val1)` method in the `GeneralHelpers` class, raises opportunities for consolidation to promote a more modular and DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) approach. By encapsulating such common functionality within dedicated methods or classes, the codebase becomes more concise, easier to maintain, and less prone to errors.

Furthermore, certain code segments were recognized as having the potential for broader applicability in future logic development. For instance, the `addDBWhereIn($query, $col, $arr)` method in the `DBHelpers` class exhibits characteristics that make it valuable for handling similar operations in future development tasks. This recognition encourages the extraction and encapsulation of such utility functions, contributing to a more extensible and adaptable codebase.

The proposed code refactoring aims to improve the overall quality of the codebase by addressing specific pain points and embracing best practices in software development. The identified improvements not only enhance the current code but also lay the groundwork for a more flexible and scalable architecture in future iterations of the project.
